# Eternity
Eternity implementation for the ESIEA GLPOO course.

The pieces are vectorized.
The CSV part was made convoluted on purpose :)
There's few tests because I only tested what I thought was difficult.

Note ALL of this was made exclusively in public transports or during car rides (where I wasn't the one driving).
